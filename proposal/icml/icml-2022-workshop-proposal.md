# Teaching Machine Learning at ICML2022

## Abstract

Machine Learning-based approaches have become ubiquitous in many areas of society, industry and academia. Understanding what Machine Learning is, providing and reproducing what it infers, has become an essential prerequisite for adoption. In this line of thought, course materials, introductory media and lecture series of a broad variety, depth, quality and public availability have come to existence. With this workshop, we want to expand on an academic discussion on what works and what doesn't in teaching machine learning. We hope, this effort helps to improve existing material and makes conceiving new material more effective for all parties involved.

With last year's second edition of this workshop, we would like to commit ourselves to the cause and continue the exchange of diagnostics, experiences and knowledge in the community. In this vein of thought, we hope to establish a continuous engagement of the community co-located with an internationally respected conference.

## Content

The main goal of this workshop is to motivate and nourish best practices for teaching machine learning in a variety of settings, from large lecture halls and MOOCs to small liberal arts colleges and research groups. Our workshop seeks to bring together machine learning practitioners and researchers who want to teach more efficiently and effectively, thus supporting the field's effort to be more diverse and inclusive. 

What is more, the Teaching Machine Learning workshop is timely as we wrestle with how to teach machine learning in an ever shifting landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our educational spaces again and again over the last two years and has demonstrated more acutely disparities in access to education and technology (both often relying on consistent economic resources). This workshop aims to bring together those who have successfully created more inclusive machine learning classrooms with those seeking to do the same at their institutions. 

Our workshop will focus on sharing and discussing the best, evidence-based teaching methods and pedagogies, like the structured approach to teaching used by the carpentries (carpentries.org), variations thereof or alternatives to it. Aspects of these modern teaching methods include: course context, pre- and post-workshop surveys, learner profiles, learning goals and objectives, giving teaching feedback. With this, we hope to equip attendees with a structured approach to teaching. In this workshop, we like to bring together practitioners to assess the usefulness of these methods in the Machine Learning community.

The central activity of the workshop will be an expanded poster session called **community connect** based on the accepted papers. Authors can choose to present their work via a poster or lightning talk, but the goal is for participants and authors to connect about the ideas in the papers. There will be a **call-for-papers prior to the workshop** followed by an open peer review. We like to attract at maximum 4 page long mini-articles that present or discuss a teaching activity related to machine learning. These mini papers are expected to present teaching examples from various aspects of teaching ML, such as: 

* a demo of how to teach back-propagation
* expectation management for non-computer science learners of ML
* a discussion of an instructive data set for teaching Convolutional Neural Networks
* an interactive web application to play with parameters of a classifier (SVM, CNN, MLP, ...)
* a teaching metaphor to illustrate time series prediction
* a (interactive) visualization of stochastic gradient descent

We will conduct an open peer review on all contributions and select papers based on the reviewers' feedback.

Participants of our workshop will be motivated to provide feedback to their peers and these presentations in focused discussion groups. Depending on the time and number of submissions, we will divide the presentations based on the field they focus on: vision applications, language applications, general concepts etc. Each of these working groups is asked to collect general patterns on what works and what doesn't. After this session, we will compile a report to summarize and publish the findings of this event and lay the foundation for future activities.

## Appeal to ICML audiences

Many experts and practitioners who develop Machine Learning models or infrastructure are confronted with the opportunity (or duty) to teach machine learning at some point in their career. Traditionally, many rely on their own experiences as learners or their gut feeling to design courses. The methods of choice are often PowerPoint or similar technologies and a lot of copy and pasting from the web. Few machine learning instructors consider if these methods and examples lead to students deeply learning these technical ideas. 

This workshop targets those who would like to teach more effectively, more equitably, and more efficiently. By sharing ideas from around the globe about various approaches to teaching Machine Learning, participants will leave with both new pedagogical ideas but also join a community of machine learning practitioners who consider questions such as: How deep do they dive into the matter? What mental models do they use to visualize concepts? What media is at play in teaching ML by others? 

With this workshop, we hope that by the end of the day, all participants have at least one concrete idea to apply to their classrooms that will make their teaching more efficient and the learning in their classrooms more effective. By collecting teaching examples, we also hope to lay the basis of subsequent studies on trends and directions in the field of didactics in AI.

## Tentative Timetable

We aim for a workshop to last one full day. The table below lists a tentative agenda. 

| time     | Title             | Speaker    |
| --:      | :--               | :--        |
| 9.00 am  | Welcome           | Organizers |
| 9.15 am  | keynote 1         | All        |
| 10.00 am | community connect | All        |
| 10.30 am | workshop          | All        |
| 12.00 am | Lunch             |            |
| 2.00 pm  | keynote 2         | All        |
| 2.45 pm  | community connect | All        |
| 3.15 pm  | workshop          | All        |
| 5.15 pm  | Farewell          |            |


The 2020 and 2021 editions of this workshop were conducted purely virtually at ECML-PKDD. During the edition of 2020, we split this agenda into two parts: a satellite event for the keynote speakers followed a week later by the main workshop event with lightning talks and community discussions. This two-part approach was well received by participants to not fall victim of zoom fatique. We followed the same approach in 2021.

Given the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are prepared for a number of contingencies. If an in-person event is possible, we would use a hybrid approach for this workshop in 2022. As the interest in the workshop has become more geographically diverse, we expect that European participants will either physically join the full day or log in during the morning. Conversely, interested parties in Pacific time zones are more likely to join for the second half of the day. Running the workshop in parallel will hence entitle both physical participation and remote interactions. However, if necessary, we can fall back to the model from 2020 and 2021. 

Regardless of whether the workshop is hybrid or fully remote, the activities will include:

- keynotes: longer in-depth presentations by leading figures in the field that work on aspects that touch on activities of our communities
- community connect: an activity to support networking in the community and to spread the content of accepted papers (physical or remote poster sessions on platforms like gather.town appeared suitable for this in the past)
- group discussions: a targeted discussion in groups among the participants; we will poll the participants on possible topics, split accordingly and then report back to the general audience to summarize the discussion

An overview article about discussed topics during the workshop will be created after the event to accompany the proceedings.

## History

The [2021](https://teaching-ml.github.io/2021/) edition of this workshop was conducted at ECML-PKDD fully virtually. The same holds for the [2020](https://teaching-ml.github.io/2020/) iteration of this workshop.

The 2021 workshop witnessed an exceptional growth in paper submissions. Of 20 papers submitted, the reviewers agreed to accept 16 articles. While some of the core ideas of these papers overlap, there are exceptions that were spurred by the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic which affected all instructors and learners. 

## Similar past and current events at ICML and NeurIPS in the last 1-2 years

In the last two years, there has only been one workshop related to education and machine learning: [Math AI for Education: Bridging the Gap Between Research and Smart Education](https://mathai4ed.github.io/) at NeurIPS 2021. We believe that our proposed workshop and the Math in AI for Education workshop are distinct for a number of reasons. First, the Math AI for education workshop focused on designing (AI) technologies for teaching math, while our workshop that focuses on techniques and pedagogies for efficiently and effectively teaching machine learning. 

Second, our workshop appeals both to experienced and beginner stage instructors of ML. As ML and data science proliferate in non-STEM disciplines, teaching machine learning will no longer only be taught in computer science and statistics departments. In this spirit, our workshop offers a platform to exchange didactical approaches and best practices (some with empirical proof) in this heterogeneous field. Moreover, our topic focus extends to a larger audience than specialised workshops like mathai4ed as not all universities globally offer the same level of digital infrastructure.
