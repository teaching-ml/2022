# Teaching Machine Learning at ECML2020

## Abstract

Machine Learning based approaches have become ubiquitous in many areas of society, industry and academia. Understanding what Machine Learning is, providing and reproducing what it infers, has become an essential prerequisite for adoption. In this line of thought, course materials, introductory media and lecture series of a broad variety, depth, quality and public availability have come to existence. With this workshop, we want to expand on an academic discussion on what works and what doesn't in teaching machine learning. We hope, this effort helps to improve existing material and makes conceiving new material more effective for all parties involved.

With last years first edition of this workshop, we would like to commit ourselves to the cause and continue the exchange of diagnostics, experiences and knowledge in the community. In this vein of thought, we hope to establish a continuous engagement of the community colocated with an internationally respected conference.
