The main goal of this workshop is to motivate and nourish best practices at any stage of the teaching process. For this, we would like to cover a structured approach to teaching motivated by [the carpentries][cdh], variations thereof or alternatives to it. Aspects of these modern teaching methods include: course context, pre- and post-workshop surveys, learner profiles, learning goals and objectives, giving teaching feedback. With this, we hope to equip attendees with a structured approach to teaching. In this workshop, we like to bring together practitioners to assess the usefulness of these methonds in the Machine Learning community.

The central activity of the workshop will be a (potentially parallel) **presentation of 5-10 minute lightning talks** based on the accepted papers. These contributions recruit themselves from a **call-for-papers prior to the workshop**. We like to attract at maximum 4 page long mini articles that present or discuss a teaching activity related to machine learning. These mini papers are expected to present teaching examples from various aspects of teaching ML. For example:

* a demo of how to teach backpropagation
* expectation management for non-computer science learners of ML
* a discussion of an instructive data set for teaching Convolutional Neural Networks
* an interactive web application to play with parameters of a classifier (SVM, CNN, MLP, ...)
* a teaching metaphor to illustrate time series prediction
* a (interactive) vizualisation of stochastic gradient decent

We will conduct an open peer review on all contributions and select papers based on the reviewers feedback.

Participants of our workshop will be motivated to provide feedback to their peers and to these presentations in focused discussion groups. Depending on the time and number of submissions, we will divide the presentations based on the field they focus on: vision applications, language applications, general concepts etc. Each of these working groups is asked to collect general patterns on what works and what doesn't. After this session, we will compile a report to summarize and publish the findings of this event and to lay the foundation for furture activites.
