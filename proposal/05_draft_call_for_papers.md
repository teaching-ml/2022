## Tentative Call for Papers

All papers will be published in with [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/). The papers must be written in English and formatted according to the [ICML 2019 latex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml-2019-submission-template/vkqjjvzjvhdc).

The maximum length of papers is 4 pages (excluding references and acknowledgements) in this format. The program chairs reserve the right to reject any over-length papers without review. Papers that ‘cheat’ the page limit by, including but not limited to, using smaller than specified margins or font sizes will also be treated as over-length. Note that for example negative vspaces are also not allowed.

Additional materials (e.g. proofs, audio, images, video, data, or source code) can be provided as URLs inside the paper of your submission. The reviewers and the program committee reserve the right to judge the paper solely based on the 4 pages; looking at any additional material is at the discretion of the reviewers and is not required.

We strive to pursue a double-blind review process. All papers need to be ‘best-effort’ anonymized. We strongly encourage to also make code and data available anonymously (e.g., in an anonymous git repository or Dropbox folder). It is allowed to have a (non-anonymous) pre-print online, but it should not be cited in the submitted paper to preserve anonymity. Reviewers will be asked not to search for submitted work.

## Expected Submissions

Based on the feedback from last year, we expect again about 12-20 paper submissions. We were happy to establish a small network people interested in teaching ML in 2020. As we will build on this, we expect a larger attendance than 2020 which we hope levels at 30.

## Required Logistics

As we expect to conduct the workshop purely virtually, we require no infrastructure in terms of equipment. At the moment, we expect to use a zoom license provided by the workshop chairs. If that is not possible at the time of the workshop, we will inform the conference organizers.
