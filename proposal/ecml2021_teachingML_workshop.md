# Teaching Machine Learning at ECML2020

## Abstract

Machine Learning based approaches have become ubiquitous in many areas of society, industry and academia. Understanding what Machine Learning is, providing and reproducing what it infers, has become an essential prerequisite for adoption. In this line of thought, course materials, introductory media and lecture series of a broad variety, depth, quality and public availability have come to existence. With this workshop, we want to expand on an academic discussion on what works and what doesn't in teaching machine learning. We hope, this effort helps to improve existing material and makes conceiving new material more effective for all parties involved.

With last years first edition of this workshop, we would like to commit ourselves to the cause and continue the exchange of diagnostics, experiences and knowledge in the community. In this vein of thought, we hope to establish a continuous engagement of the community colocated with an internationally respected conference.
## Content

The main goal of this workshop is to motivate and nourish best practices at any stage of the teaching process. For this, we would like to cover a structured approach to teaching motivated by [the carpentries][cdh], variations thereof or alternatives to it. Aspects of these modern teaching methods include: course context, pre- and post-workshop surveys, learner profiles, learning goals and objectives, giving teaching feedback. With this, we hope to equip attendees with a structured approach to teaching. In this workshop, we like to bring together practitioners to assess the usefulness of these methonds in the Machine Learning community.

The central activity of the workshop will be a (potentially parallel) **presentation of 5-10 minute lightning talks** based on the accepted papers. These contributions recruit themselves from a **call-for-papers prior to the workshop**. We like to attract at maximum 4 page long mini articles that present or discuss a teaching activity related to machine learning. These mini papers are expected to present teaching examples from various aspects of teaching ML. For example:

* a demo of how to teach backpropagation
* expectation management for non-computer science learners of ML
* a discussion of an instructive data set for teaching Convolutional Neural Networks
* an interactive web application to play with parameters of a classifier (SVM, CNN, MLP, ...)
* a teaching metaphor to illustrate time series prediction
* a (interactive) vizualisation of stochastic gradient decent

We will conduct an open peer review on all contributions and select papers based on the reviewers feedback.

Participants of our workshop will be motivated to provide feedback to their peers and to these presentations in focused discussion groups. Depending on the time and number of submissions, we will divide the presentations based on the field they focus on: vision applications, language applications, general concepts etc. Each of these working groups is asked to collect general patterns on what works and what doesn't. After this session, we will compile a report to summarize and publish the findings of this event and to lay the foundation for furture activites.
## Appeal to ECML audiences

Many experts and practitioners who develop Machine Learning models or infrastructure around these models are confronted with the opportunity or duty to teach machine learning at some point in their career. Traditionally, many  rely on their gut feeling to design courses that are motivated by these circumstances. The methods of choice are often Power Point or similar technologies and a lot of copy&pasting from the web. 

This workshop targets those who would like to know how teachers from around the globe approach teaching Machine Learning: How deep do they dive into the matter? What mental models do they use to visualize concepts? What media is at play in teaching ML by others? 

With this workshop, we hope that by the end of the day, all participants have a better feeling where they stand with their teaching. By collecting teaching examples, we also hope to lay the basis of subsequent studies on trends and directions in the field of didactics in AI.

## Previous Venues

Our workshop was successfully established in 2020 at ECMLPKDD. The workshop details can be inferred on our [dedicated homepage for 2020](https://teaching-ml.github.io/2020/). During both events, this first-off implementation attracted 20-30 participants. In this context, the following papers were accepted and discussed:

- “Introductory Machine Learning for non STEM students” by Javier Garcia-Algarra
- “An Interactive Web Application for Decision Tree Learning” by Miriam Elia, Carola Gajek, Alexander Schiendorfer, Wolfgang Reif
- “Teaching Computational Machine Learning (without Statistics)” by Katherine M. Kinnaird
- “AI is not Just a Technology” by Claudia Engel, Nicole Coleman
- “Teaching the Foundations of Machine Learning with Candy” by Daniela Huppenkothen, Gwendolyn Eadie
- “Turning Software Engineers into Machine Learning Engineers” by Alexander Schiendorfer, Carola Gajek, Wolfgang Reif



## Tentative Timetable

We aim for a workshop to last one full day. The table below lists a tentative agenda.

The 2020 edition of this workshop was conducted purely virtually. During the edition of 2020, we split this agenda into two parts that we delivered within one weeks time difference. This separation was well received by participants to not fall victim of zoom fatique. We expect that in 2021 we will have to consider following this model.
## Tentative Call for Papers

All papers will be published in with [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/). The papers must be written in English and formatted according to the [ICML 2019 latex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml-2019-submission-template/vkqjjvzjvhdc).

The maximum length of papers is 4 pages (excluding references and acknowledgements) in this format. The program chairs reserve the right to reject any over-length papers without review. Papers that ‘cheat’ the page limit by, including but not limited to, using smaller than specified margins or font sizes will also be treated as over-length. Note that for example negative vspaces are also not allowed.

Additional materials (e.g. proofs, audio, images, video, data, or source code) can be provided as URLs inside the paper of your submission. The reviewers and the program committee reserve the right to judge the paper solely based on the 4 pages; looking at any additional material is at the discretion of the reviewers and is not required.

We strive to pursue a double-blind review process. All papers need to be ‘best-effort’ anonymized. We strongly encourage to also make code and data available anonymously (e.g., in an anonymous git repository or Dropbox folder). It is allowed to have a (non-anonymous) pre-print online, but it should not be cited in the submitted paper to preserve anonymity. Reviewers will be asked not to search for submitted work.

## Expected Submissions

Based on the feedback from last year, we expect again about 12-20 paper submissions. We were happy to establish a small network people interested in teaching ML in 2020. As we will build on this, we expect a larger attendance than 2020 which we hope levels at 30.

## Required Logistics

As we expect to conduct the workshop purely virtually, we require no infrastructure in terms of equipment. At the moment, we expect to use a zoom license provided by the workshop chairs. If that is not possible at the time of the workshop, we will inform the conference organizers.
## History

The 2020 edition of this workshop was conducted at ECML-PKDD fully virtually.
